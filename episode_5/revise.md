# separate file's for separate components

1. why is "src"?

2. what is difference between export defult & just export?
- in a single file you're exporting more than one thing to export then, just export attached to the const declaration will be way!
- export default will be one file, one component!
- that why while importing the just export thing it all will wrapped a {}, export default will be normal the variable itself!

3. never ever have hard coded data at the component file, put those all in the utils folder!

4. can I have the both way of export in a same files?
