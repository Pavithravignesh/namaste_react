# here we're going to build a food ordering app!

# plan is very first in development,

1. how to make the component dynamic?

- using props!

2. what is passing prop to component will be like?

- passing, argument to a function and props to component ar e jus the same!

3. how does the passing of props occurs in react?

- 1. we can pass as many as props,
  2. those all will be wrapped into a js object, and forms as a single obj,
  3. can be destructured at the component as usual!
