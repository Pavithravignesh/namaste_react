# here we're going to build a food ordering app!

# plan is very first in development,

1. how to make the component dynamic?

- using props!

2. what is passing prop to component will be like?

- passing, argument to a function and props to component ar e jus the same!

3. how does the passing of props occurs in react?

- we can pass as many as props,
- those all will be wrapped into a js object, and forms as a single obj,
- can be destructured at the component as usual!

4. what is "config driven ui"?

- regionally or under some constrain UI can be altered as it'll be different for one place to another,
- backend control can be do this!

5. what is cloudinary?

6. what is re-useable components as it links with dynamically passing data into the component?

7. why unique id for every child?

- if react known which child has came new to the list, then it'll that newly arrived alone instead of doing the list again, it's bigger thing in code optimization!
- simply react doesn't unique identify the element, unless we've gave it as id attribute.

8, doesn't use index as id, Index as a key is an anti-pattern!
