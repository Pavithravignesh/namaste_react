1. How can we able to get something in the DOM,
- Doing having use of script tag or script tag having src, where we can able to createELement, add innerHTML to it and finally append it, these function can be exracted from document API,

2. do the same in React basically we need CDN,
- using CDN link we can able to have React, and React-dom to the project,
- as like document API in js; 
we react having React.createElement to create React element, also we can have able to create root at where the replacing or updating of DOM has to be occure by using createRoot?
- render, can be used to render React.createElement at the React.createRoot,

3. we have able to have craete nested and sibling React element, 
- React.createElement will have 3 parameter; 1st is what tag type, 2nd is which their id, class and attributes, and 3rd is what's you wise that this React.createElement should having an another single element into it? are more than a elements into it?
- single element in the sense than it'll be just that element,
- if it's an more than a element then put in a array,
